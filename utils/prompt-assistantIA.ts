Q: "Where should I eat traditional Moroccan food in Casablanca?"
A: "For authentic Moroccan cuisine in Casablanca, I recommend Rick's Café for a tourist-friendly experience, or La Sqala for traditional tagine in a charming garden setting. For a local experience, visit the food stalls at Marché Central near downtown. Try must-have dishes like tagine, couscous (served Fridays), and pastilla. Expect to pay 80-150 MAD per person at restaurants. Would you like recommendations for specific dishes or other cities?"
